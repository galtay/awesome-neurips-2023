Caption: Wordcloud of all NeurIPS 2023 titles

Welcome to the hub for all things [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/)! We scraped the data for all 3500+ NeurIPS projects and dove into the depths of Hugging Face, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Arxiv to pick out the most interesting content.

In this repo, you will find:

- [Data Analysis](#data-analysis): detailed analysis of the titles and abstracts from NeurIPS 2023 accepted papers
- [Awesome Projects](#cool-neurips-projects): synthesized collection of 40 NeurIPS 2023 papers you won't want to miss
- [Conference Schedule](#conference-schedule): comprehensive listing of all NeurIPS 2023 projects (title, authors, abstract) organized by poster session and sorted alphabetically

_Note_: Our data contains 3581 out of the 3584 accepted papers. If you are an author of one of the 3 remaining papers, I sincerely apologize, and would love for you to get in touch so we can add the paper :)

## Data Analysis
